# Energy Agents
This repository contains samples for the usage of Energy Agents. Without much theoretical or scientific entitlement, we would like to claim here that those Energy Agents can either be seen as micro energy management system that can be used in distributed energy scenarios (e.g. in Peer-to-Peer markets & Blockchain) or that they can be used in central cloud applications to control energy systems from elesewher (e.g. Virtual Power Plants or Demand Site Manangement). 

For such, and for the development over the next years, the notion of Energy Agents and the tools presented here, might be used in scientific research or in real-world applications helping to support the digitization of our energy systems and markets, as we hope.

The folowing introductions and tutorials can be found in the Wiki of this project:
* **Getting in touch - Running the example scenario on your machine:** [Download](https://github.com/EnFlexIT/AgentWorkbench/releases) the [Agent.Workbench](https://github.com/EnFlexIT/AgentWorkbench) core application and navigate to *Projects* => *Repository Import* => select the *awbProjectRepositor* in the combo box above => select *Energy Agent - Example Project* and press the *Install* button. [A more detailed description can be found in the Wiki](https://github.com/EnFlexIT/EnergyAgentExample/wiki/1.-Run-the-example),

* **Understanding the example project:** [This Wiki article](https://github.com/EnFlexIT/EnergyAgentExample/wiki/2.-Understand-the-Example) describes the intention and the background of the provided agent-based execution environment for simulaton and on-site usage. Further, it explains the core structure of an Energy Agent and the types of simulation sequences that can be used with the example.  

* **Feature List:** The list contains loosely coupled (but not unstructured) aspects about *Energy Agents*, the *Energy Option Model* and *Agent.Workbench*. It is also used as link destination for other articles. Nevertheless, a [look at the collection](https://github.com/EnFlexIT/EnergyAgentExample/wiki/3.-Feature-List) is worthwhile.

* **Agent.Workbench Expandability:** Agent.Workbench, the HyGrid feature and Energy Agents represent  a base tool or toolchain that enables you to build whatever application you like. For this, you might be interessted in how you can add further OSGI-features to the AWB framework, add new tabs to the project window, add new menus or toolbar items or how you can individually control the start of your agents.


# Develop your own Energy Agents
* **Setting up your development environment:** To develop your own Energy Agents and extend the AWB example project, requires to install the above described example project and the *Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers*.
