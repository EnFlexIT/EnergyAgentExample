# Energy Agents
This repository contains samples for the usage of Energy Agents. Without much theoretical or scientific entitlement, we would like to claim here that those Energy Agents can be seen either as potential micro energy management system that can be used in distributed energy scenarios (e.g. in Peer-to-Peer markets & Blockchain) or that they can be used in central cloud applications to control energy systems from elesewher (e.g. Virtual Power Plants or Demand Site Manangement). 

For such, and for the development over the next years, the notion of Energy Agents and the tools presented here, might be used in scientific research or in real-world applications helping to support the digitization of our energy systems and markets, as we hope.

The folowing introductions and tutorials can be found in the Wiki of this project:
